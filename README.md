# Deprecation

API version 3 is scheduled for deprecation on January 16th, 2018 and as part of the deprecation process this driver is no longer being updated or maintained. We encourage use of the new API version 4 driver available in our [mattermost-redux](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux) library moving forward.

# Mattermost JavaScript API Library

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mattermost.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mattermost) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/mattermost.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-driver-javascript/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

A library for interacting with the [Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/platform) API.

Available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mattermost)

To contribute, please see [Contribution Guidelines](http://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html)

## Usage

### Installation

The library can be installed using npm:

```
npm install mattermost --save
```

### Usage

Example import methods:

```javascript
var Mattermost = require('mattermost');
var client = new Mattermost.Client()
```

```javascript
import {Client} from 'mattermost';
const client = new Client();
```

### API

API Documentation is coming soon. For now, take a look at the [client.jsx](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-driver-javascript/blob/master/client.jsx) file.


## Development

### Building 

`make build` - Compiles client.jsx into a minified lib/client.js

`make publish` - Walks though the steps to publish the package (manually)

`make clean` - Cleans up compiled bits and npm dependencies. 

### Tests

The tests are in the [main repository](https://github.com/mattermost/platform/tree/master/webapp/tests). This is because they require the server to run.
